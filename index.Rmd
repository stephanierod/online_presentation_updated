# Introduction & Background 

* Consecutive Interpreting is a mode of interpreting that is carried out in real-time as the interpreter begins to interpret the speech from the speaker only after the speaker has finished speaking. (Maulida & Saehu, 2022).

* To successfully accomplish an interpreting task, the interpreter is required to be proficient in the source and target language, store a large amount of linguistic information in their working memory, and overcome the stressors or public speaking. 

* Speech disfluencies vary depending on the interpreter's cognitive traits, such as, language proficiency, working memory, and anxiety.

---
# Research Questions

**RQ1.** What is the frequency and type of speech disfluencies in consecutive interpreting by student interpreters?

**RQ2.** What is the relationship between language proficiency, working memory, anxiety, and speech disfluencies in consecutive interpreting by student interpreters?

# Speech Disfluencies 

## What are they?

* Disfluencies are generally described as interruptions of the
execution of a speech plan (Postma et al., 1990). 

* Disfluencies mainly include pauses, fillers, repetitions, and articulatory disfluencies.

# Participants 

<br>

```{r, data-frame-participants, echo=FALSE}
participants <- data.frame(
  Category = c("Number of participants", "Gender", "Language background", "Interpreting experience"),
  Description = c("53 (45 females and 8 males)", "Female: 45, Male: 8", "Chinese-English bilinguals", "1 year of interpreting training")
)

knitr::kable(participants)
```

<br> All participants trained in English language in the first 2 years of their university education and started to train in interpreting from the 3rd year onward.

## Procedure

* **Language Proficiency Test**: Based on the Test for English Majors Band 8, which included a reading comprehension part, listening comprehension part, and a writing composition part. 

* **Working Memory Test**: Adapted from the paradigm developed in Mizera (2006), in which participants memorized a list of Chinese words and made a sentence for each word. 
* **Anxiety Questionnaire**: Two-part test (1) self-efficacy anxiety (i.e., the anxiety one feels on the ability to complete a particular task), and (2) state-trait anxiety (anxiety level as a personal characteristic).

* **Interpreting Test**: English into Chinese consecutive interpreting task adapted from the China Aptitude Test for Translators and Interpreters (CATTI) Level II.

# Experiment
## Anxiety Questionnaire 
Questionnaire used a scale developed in Zhang and Schwarzer (1995), which was translated into Chinese by Dong et al. (2013b). 

**Two part scale** -->  Part 1 tested self-efficacy anxiety, which is the anxiety one feels regarding whether he/she can do a particular task, and Part 2 tested state-trait anxiety, which is the level of anxiety as a personal characteristic.

Each response was scored on a point scale of 1-4, and the participant's total score for anxiety was the sum of all the points in the 30 test items.

              "Pauses", "Test location", "Equipment", "Instructions", "Note-taking", 
              "Cue to start interpreting", "Recording", "Test duration"),

                  "Speech was segmented for consecutive interpreting", "Pauses lasted about 1.5 times the duration of the preceding segment",

                  "Allowed during speech", "Audio signal 'ding'", "Participants' interpreting was individually recorded", 
                  "About 25 minutes")
)

# Results

Participants’ interpreting scores increased as a function of their language proficiency (β = 1.07, SE = 0.33, t = 3.4, p = 0.002), increased as a function of their working memory (β = 0.36, SE = 0.10, t = 3.40, p = 0.002), and decreased as a function of their anxiety level (β = −0.22, SE = 0.08, t = −2.66, p = 0.011). 

A significant correlation was found between a participant’s interpreting score and their total disfluency rate (r = −0.40, t = −3.11, p = 0.004).

Descriptive statistics of different disfluency rates (out of 1,000 characters in target output).

# Presentation of Results

1. The author presented descriptive statistics to characterize the participants and the frequency of different types of disfluencies. 

2. A correlation analysis was conducted to examine the relationship between interpreting score and disfluency rate. 

3. A linear regression analysis was used to investigate the effects of three cognitive factors on interpreting score (language proficiency, working memory, and anxiety).

4. A logistic regression analysis was performed to investigate the effects of the cognitive factors on the occurrence of different types of disfluencies.

# Analysis of Interpreting Score Results 

* Participants’ interpreting scores increased as a function
of their language proficiency, working memory, and decreased as a
function of their anxiety level, which demonstrates a significant correlation between a participant’s interpreting score and their total disfluency rate (r = −0.40, t = −3.11, p = 0.004). 

* Participants who had a higher overall disfluency rate demonstrated a decreased score in interpreting performance.

* This presents a compelling argument that cognitive factors are important to consider when assessing interpreting performance. 


---
# Analysis of Disfluencies Results 

*  In general, there were approximately 45 disfluencies out of 1,000 morphemes/characters in the target language output.

* There was a significant correlation between a participant's interpreting score and their total disfluency rate, indicating that participants with higher disfluency rate performed worse when interpreting.

* The rate of total disfleucnies did not reveal any significant effect of the cognitive factors. However, anxiety had a significant effect on the frequency of disfluencies. 

---

# Appropriateness/novelty of analysis

* The study's analysis of the collected data appears appropriate and contributes to the field of interpreting studies by investigating the relationship between cognitive factors (language proficiency, working memory, and anxiety) and speech disfluencies. 

* The selected statistical analysis methods provide a comprehensive examination of the variables being investigated. 

* The findings provide insight for interpreting training programs to incorporate exercises that target these cognitive factors to improve interpreting performance. 

---
# Overall Evaluation

* Articulatory disfluencies were rare, however this recording could be a result of a floor effect, which provides a limitation when examining RQ1. 

* Another limitation is that the study based on the experiment structure, cannot determine whether anxiety directly causes speech disfluencies, or if there were other variables that contributed to speech disfluencies.

* The anxiety questionnaire is decently short and does not ask specific interpreting task questions. 

* It would be encouraged for future studies to design an experiment in which other underlying factors may be what is contributing to anxiety and speech disfluencies in interpreting.
